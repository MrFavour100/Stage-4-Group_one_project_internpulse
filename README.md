## 📌 Project Title
**Tackling Mental Health & Social Media Pressure Among Nigerian Gen Z**

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project addresses the increasing concern of mental health challenges among Nigerian Gen Z, particularly in relation to the pressures created by social media usage. Our objective was to explore the root causes, assess current support gaps, and propose a digital, mobile-first mental health solution tailored to this demographic.

## 🎯 Goals
Investigate how social media contributes to anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem among Nigerian Gen Z.
Analyze survey data to uncover patterns and insights on mental health awareness and coping strategies.
Recommend a tech-driven solution that is accessible, stigma-free, and culturally relevant.

## 📊 Methodology
**Data Collection:** We created and distributed a survey targeted at Nigerian Gen Z respondents.

**Data Cleaning & Analysis:** Conducted in Excel and interpreted using charts and summary statistics.

**Insight Extraction:** Identified recurring pain points, trends in social media use, and willingness to adopt digital mental health tools.

**Final Output:** A slide presentation and this GitHub repo containing our full documentation.

## 💡 Key Insights
- A significant portion of respondents experience anxiety, self-comparison, and digital fatigue.
